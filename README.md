# Sleep Timer

It's just a simple code created about 15 minutes, because i am to lazy to find sleep timer software which is not to simple, i like to keep it clean and simple.

Didn't add a security handling yet, it's just the thing to doing things.

Simple execution command to timer down the PC, based on http request by form handled by express.js

This thing very usefull when i just lay down watching the movie and to lazy to wake up.

So this simple task doing good job for me.

Upcoming updates, i don't think so but i thought about making this in to electron instead because now this thing only use chrome with flags. lol

`git clone https://github.com/RamaMahardika/sleep-timer.git`

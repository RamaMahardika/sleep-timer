# Sleep Timer

Didn't add a security handling yet, it's just the thing to doing thing.

Simple execution command to timer down the PC, very usefull when i just lay down watching the movie and to lazy to wake up.

So this simple task doing good job for me.

Upcoming updates, i thing about recoded this in to electron instead because this thing now only use the chrome with flags.

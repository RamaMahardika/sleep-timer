# Sleep Timer

It's just a simple code created about 15 minutes, because i am to lazy to find sleep timer software which is not to simple, i like to keep it clean and simple.

Didn't add a security handling yet, it's just the thing to doing things.

Upcoming updates, i don't think so but i thought about making this in to electron instead because now this thing only use chrome with flags. lol

`git clone https://github.com/RamaMahardika/sleep-timer.git`

`npm install`

`npm start or npm run forever`
